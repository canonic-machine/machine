# <NAME>

This repository carries the triad of governance files.

- `CANON.md` defines the constitution for this scope.
- `VOCAB.md` defines the terms used by this scope.
- `README.md` (this file) describes the scope purpose and relation of CANON, SPEC, and VOCAB.

The machine enforces this scope downstream.
