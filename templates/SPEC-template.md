# SPEC Template

```
Title / identifier (e.g., <scope>.md - <area>)

1. Purpose
   - why this spec exists (constraints not covered by CANON).

2. Scope
   - which layers inherit from it.

3. Constraints
   - human-readable rules that guide implementers.

4. Validation
   - how downstream consumers check for compliance.

5. Consumption notes
   - instructions for downstream repositories (VOCAB updates, README updates, template use).

Every spec inherits CANON’s triad invariants, references the VOCAB glossary, and points back to README for human context.
