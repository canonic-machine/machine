# VOCAB Template

This vocabulary explains the CANON template. Define the terms used by CANON, SPEC, README, and this VOCAB. Add additional terms for any extra axioms.

```
# VOCAB (/)

## Core terms

### CANON
<define the constraints artifact for a scope>

### inheritance
<define how a CANON links to a parent scope and how chains terminate>

### final
<define the non-overridable status of inherited axioms>

### triad
<define the required governance file set: CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md>

### introspection
<describe how this VOCAB defines itself and the CANON, SPEC, and README it supports>

### SPEC
<define the declarative artifact that is the first source of truth>

### README
<define the narrative artifact that explains a scope>

### VOCAB
<define this vocabulary artifact itself—its responsibility to define terms for CANON, SPEC, and README>

### scope
<define the area governed by a CANON and its triad>

### axiom
<define a single CANON statement>

### term
<define a word or phrase that must be defined in VOCAB>

### template
<define the reusable blueprint for instantiating governance artifacts>

### define
<define how terms or rules are stated in VOCAB, CANON, or SPEC>

## Additional terms

### <term>
<define any other term used by scope-specific axioms>

End of VOCAB.
