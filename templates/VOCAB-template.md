# VOCAB Template

This vocabulary explains the CANON template. Define these terms when describing any CANON scope built from the template.

```
# VOCAB (/)

## Core terms

### CANON
<define the constitutional constraints that remain stable across downstream scopes>

### VOCAB
<define this vocabulary artifact itself—its responsibility to document the template and keep definitions aligned>

### triad
<define the required governance file set: CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md>

### inheritance
<describe how every CANON links to a parent scope and how chains terminate>

### final
<define the non-overridable status of inherited axioms>

### coherence
<define the semantic consistency expectation captured by the template>

### compliance
<define the structural requirement (triad + documentation) enforced by the template>

### governance
<define how coherence and compliance combine to secure a governed scope>

### invalidity
<define when a scope becomes invalid (e.g., missing files, contradictory constraints)>

### introspection
<describe how this VOCAB documents itself and the CANON template, closing the introspection loop between governance artifacts>

End of VOCAB.
