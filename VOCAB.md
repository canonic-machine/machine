# VOCAB (/machine)

## Core terms

### CANON
The constraints artifact for the machine scope, inheriting the root CANON.

### CANONIC
The root paradigm scope the machine layer inherits from and enforces.

### coherence
The property that machine CANON statements do not contradict inherited CANON.

### compliance
The property that the triad exists and inheritance is declared for the machine scope.

### correction
History-preserving change executed by the machine layer to restore governed states.

### final
The property that inherited axioms cannot be overridden by downstream scopes.

### governance
The state where coherence and compliance both hold.

### inheritance
The declared linkage from the machine scope to the scope it inherits from.

### introspection
The requirement that VOCAB defines itself and the CANON it supports.

### invalidity
The state of not being governed.

### machine
The validation engine layer responsible for correction and ordering checks.

### ordering
The machine function that enforces required ordering (e.g., alphabetical VOCAB terms).

### SPEC
A declarative artifact that defines patterns or constraints for machine enforcement.

### template
A reusable blueprint for instantiating a governance artifact.

### triad
The required set of governance artifacts: CANON.md, VOCAB.md, README.md.

### VOCAB
The meanings artifact for a scope; it defines the terms used by CANON and defines itself.
