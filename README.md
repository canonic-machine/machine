# MACHINE

This repository carries the minimal triad for the validation layer plus the machine spec.

- `CANON.md` defines the machine constitution.
- `VOCAB.md` defines the machine terms and self-description.
- `README.md` (this file) describes the machine scope.
- `MACHINE.md` defines the minimal spec for enforcing CANONIC.

Machine validation performs correction and ordering without rewriting history.
