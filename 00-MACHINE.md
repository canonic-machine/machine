# MACHINE

1. Purpose
   - Define the minimal MACHINE scope.
   - Enforce the CANONIC constitution only.

2. Scope
   - Applies to /canonic/machine/ and informs inherited scopes.

3. Constraints
   - Machine enforces the CANONIC constitution only.
   - Machine behavior is defined by CANON axioms (input, evaluation, decision, signal, determinism).
   - OS enforces non-constitutional constraints for machine scopes.

4. Validation
   - Triad present.
   - CANON includes constitution enforcement and machine axioms.
   - OS exists for downstream enforcement.

5. Consumption notes
   - Downstream scopes inherit this spec and may add constraints without contradicting CANONIC.
   - Enforcement beyond the constitution lives in OS.

This SPEC is part of the machine triad and references VOCAB for definitions.
