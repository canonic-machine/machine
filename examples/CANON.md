# CANON (examples/)

**Governance for FSM examples directory.**

**Inherits from:** [../CANON.md](../CANON.md)

This directory contains example implementations of the CANONIC FSM.

---

## Invariants

All example subdirectories must:
- Demonstrate one aspect of the FSM
- Include complete triad (CANON, VOCABULARY, README)
- Be self-contained and runnable
- Follow the 4-state structure (episodes, assets, prose, output) where applicable

---

## Defaults

### Example Structure

Each example should:
- Have a clear, focused purpose
- Include validation-ready artifacts
- Demonstrate best practices
- Be minimal (no unnecessary complexity)

**Violation:** Example lacks clear purpose or contains unnecessary complexity

### Naming

- Use descriptive directory names (minimal, basic-ledger, etc.)
- Follow existing naming conventions from parent

**Violation:** Example uses non-descriptive names or violates naming conventions

---

## Validation

Examples-level checks:
- All subdirectories have triad
- Each example is independently valid
- No broken references between examples

---

End of examples CANON.
