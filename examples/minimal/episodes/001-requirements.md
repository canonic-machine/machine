# Episode 001: Requirements

We need a simple REST API for managing users.

Core requirements:
- Create new users
- List all users
- Get user by ID
- Update user info
- Delete users

Each user needs:
- Name
- Email address
- Created timestamp

We should validate email format.

Maybe add pagination later? Not sure yet.

Error handling - need to think about this. What happens when user doesn't exist?

Authentication probably needed but that's for later.
