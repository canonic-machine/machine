# MACHINE

1. Purpose
   - Enforce CANONIC and MACHINE axioms through protocols.

2. Scope
   - Applies to `/machine` and informs inherited scopes.

3. Enforcement
   - Accept input as a structure and a specification.
   - Evaluate the structure against the specification.
   - Produce a binary decision and a non-authoritative signal.
   - Ensure determinism: identical inputs produce identical outcomes.
   - Protocols in `/machine/protocols` are CANONIC and enforce CANONIC axioms, CANONIC SPEC constraints, and machine axioms.
   - Protocols accept input and yield a decision and a signal.
   - Templates in `/machine/templates` conform to TEMPLATE.
   - Enforce coherence, compliance, governance, and invalidity for machine scopes.
   - Enforce documentation and nomenclature.
   - Enforce minimal canon, ordering, and templating.
   - Apply correction through history-preserving change.

4. Validation
   - Confirm input includes structure and specification.
   - Confirm evaluation yields a binary decision and signal.
   - Confirm signal is derived from evaluation and is not authoritative.
   - Confirm determinism for identical inputs.
   - Confirm `/machine/protocols` includes CANONIC protocols that enforce CANONIC axioms, CANONIC SPEC constraints, and machine axioms.
   - Confirm protocols accept input and yield a decision and a signal.
   - Confirm triad presence and inheritance declarations.
   - Confirm templates in `/machine/templates` conform to TEMPLATE.
   - Confirm VOCAB is CANON-closed and defines the terms used by CANON and itself.
   - Confirm README uses terms defined by VOCAB.
   - Validate coherence and compliance; derive governance and invalidity from those results.
   - Validate documentation and nomenclature for canonical artifacts.
   - Validate minimal canon, ordering, and templating requirements.
   - Apply correction without rewriting history.

5. Consumption notes
   - Downstream scopes inherit this spec and may add constraints without contradicting CANONIC.

This SPEC is part of the machine triad and references VOCAB for definitions.
