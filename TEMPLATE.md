# TEMPLATE

1. Purpose
   - Define the template function for this scope.

2. Scope
   - Applies to `/machine/templates` and informs inherited scopes.

3. Constraints
   - Templates provide structure for CANON, VOCAB, README, and SPEC.
   - Templates are used to instantiate those artifacts.
   - Templates avoid local axioms and local terms.

4. Validation
   - Confirm templates exist for CANON, VOCAB, README, and SPEC.
   - Confirm templates can be instantiated without changing their structure.
   - Confirm templates avoid local axioms and local terms.

5. Consumption notes
   - Downstream scopes instantiate templates for local scope.

This SPEC is part of the machine triad and references VOCAB for definitions.
